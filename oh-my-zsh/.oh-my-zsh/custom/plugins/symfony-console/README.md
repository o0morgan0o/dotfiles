## Oh My ZSH Completion plugin for `symfony/console` based tools
 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/symfony-console` directory.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/jerguslejko/zsh-symfony-completion.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/symfony-console
```

2. Activate the plugin by inserting `symfony-console` into the `plugins` list in your `~/.zshrc`.

```zsh
plugins=(symfony-console)
```

3. Optionally, specify which `symfony/console` tools you want to activate auto-completion for. If you do not define this variable, values below will be used as defaults. Please note, this line **MUST** appear before `source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh`.

```zsh
export SYMFONY_CONSOLE_TOOLS="composer artisan valet envoy bin/console"
```

4. Reload your shell

### Local vs Global

You can use this auto-completion plugin for local as well as global tools. It will first check if there is a file in `pwd` that matches one of tools specified in the _SYMFONY_CONSOLE_TOOLS_ list. If there is one, the plugin will use it (eg. `artisan`). Otherwise, it will try to find a globally available command (eg. `composer`).
